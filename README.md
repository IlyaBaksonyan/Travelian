Welcome to Travelian! This project showcases my web development skills using modern browser features.

## About
This website was built with a responsive, cross-browser-friendly design, leveraging CSS Grid for layout and clamp() for flexible typography.

- Just played some with dynamic scaling techniques with Vmax and Clamp ().
## Areas for Improvement
- Color Management: A more structured approach would improve scalability.
- Typography: Using variables would enhance maintainability.
- Layout: A simpler flex-based structure might have been more efficient.
