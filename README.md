### Welcome!

Hello there!

Design [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1166671197078391550)

Welcome to Travelian! This project was created to showcase my web development skills

### About

This website was built using the latest features supported by all modern browsers. Before I continue, I'd like to apologize for deviating from the original design and using grid-wrapper extensively, even if it wasn't used in the original mockup. I also didn't include any JavaScript code. Nevertheless, I believe the site is responsive, cross-browser and optimized.

media requests are few since I've been using thanks to my use of clamp() in combination with vmax (yes, even for the fonts which are very bad, but I realized that a bit late).

I hope you appreciate the code and don't think the site is overly complex or difficult to maintain.

### What I Learned

Throughout this project, I rediscovered the art of building websites without relying on frameworks and linters (pain)

### Areas for Improvement

While the site has its strengths, I acknowledge that there are areas that could be improved:

1. **Colors** - The current color implementation might make it difficult to expand or modify the site's color scheme.

2. **Fonts** - In retrospect, I should have used variables to manage fonts efficiently.

3. **Grids** - I divided sections using grid-wrapper, but in hindsight, a simpler flex approach could have sufficed.
